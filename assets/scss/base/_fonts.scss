//Uses font mixin in abstracts/mixins.scss
//Call mixin using:
//@mixin fonts($font: null, $path: '/assets/css/fonts', $weights: 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900, $woff2: true)
//Note that the mixin calls both regular and italics per weight listed
//When using a font, you'll need to use the dasherized version in SCSS/CSS; e.g. "Proxima Nova" becomes "proxima-nova".
//Change variables accordingly below


@include fonts('proxima-nova','../fonts/proxima-nova',100 200 300 400 500 700, true);
