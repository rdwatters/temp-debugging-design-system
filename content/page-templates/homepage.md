## Heading

1. This content was created in `content/page-templates/homepage.md` and written to a `.json` file that publishes to `/page-templates/index.json`. The template that creates this file can be found at `layouts/_default/section.json.json`.
2. If you want to disable the overlay of information for all page templates (e.g. during local development), set `includepagetemplateinfo = false` inside your project's `config.toml`. If you want to disable it for specific page templates, set `includepagetemplateinfo: false` inside the corresponding `.md` content file (in this case, `content/page-templates/homepage.md`).
